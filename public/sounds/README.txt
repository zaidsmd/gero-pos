To complete the cashout sound implementation:

1. Place a cashout sound file named "cashout.mp3" in this directory.
2. The sound should be short (1-3 seconds) and have a cash register or payment success sound effect.
3. You can find free sound effects on websites like:
   - https://freesound.org/
   - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/

Example search terms: "cash register", "checkout", "payment success", "ka-ching"

The sound will automatically play when a checkout is successfully completed.
